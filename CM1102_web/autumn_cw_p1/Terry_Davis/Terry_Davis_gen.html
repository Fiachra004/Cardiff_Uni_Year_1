        leave his home due to fear of people following him
        which would lead to him being reamitted into a psychiatric
        ward. He would be diagnosed with schizophrenia, this would 
        affect his personal projects where he would go on to make 
        "TempleOS" an Operating system that Davis belives god told
        him to build. Thoughout the development of templeOS Davis believed
        that he was under constant persecution from the CIA. 
        He was considered controversial due to his use of both homophobic
        and racial slurs, which many people put down to his mental Illness.
